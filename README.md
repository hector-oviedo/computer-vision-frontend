# Computer Vision (FRONTEND) Module for IU University - Research Project
This project is a React application built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, focused on providing a comparison tool for various computer vision models using frontend components. The goal is to visualize inference data (including object detection and segmentation) of different models by comparing their performance and results using widgets, charts, and frame-by-frame views.

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide a seamless user experience for loading and visualizing inference data generated by the models in the backend project (e.g., YOLOv8, EfficientDet, Detectron2). It includes dynamic components to analyze model performance based on JSON outputs, as well as visual tools for comparing frames and inference metrics side-by-side.

## Features
Dynamic component structure: Components are designed to be reusable and easily adaptable across projects.
Tailwind CSS for styling: The project uses modern utility-first CSS with responsive design.
Well-documented components: Each component will be documented with inputs, outputs, and usage instructions.
Optimized animations: Animations are applied to enhance user interactions and transitions between elements.
Support for multiple models: Allows comparing the performance of up to four models side by side.
Liquid layout: Ensures components are centered and responsive to various screen sizes.
##  Installation
Clone this repository.
Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Progress
Current Status: In progress, with ongoing development and incremental component integration. The project has been structured with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, and the basic app layout is in place.

Known Issues
- Some components are incomplete and may not function as expected.
- Test units are yet to be fully implemented for all components.
- These issues will be addressed as the development progresses, and components will be tested step-by-step.

# Backend Integration
This project is meant to work in conjunction with the [computer-vision](https://github.com/hector-oviedo/computer-vision) Backend project, which provides model inference frames and generates the JSON files necessary for this frontend.

# Future Enhancements
- Complete integration of all widgets and components.
- Implement full test coverage for components, possibly using Cypress for end-to-end testing.
- Optimize animations and transitions for better user experience.
- Finalize responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.
